## Abstract

Dietary fats modulate host physiology and the gut microbiome, but the effect of individual fats and the ability to reverse effects of a high-fat diet by changing to a low-fat diet are unclear. To address the lack of long-term data of the effects of different fats, we present here a multi-omic atlas of mice sampled longitudinally for a year that finds distinct metabolic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic changes for different high fat diets. In addition to mice that were fed the same high-fat diet for the entire study, we also included reversals that were fed a high-fat diet for four or nine months, and then a low-fat control diet for the remainder of the study. While approximately 50% of diet-induced microbial shifts revert to baseline, we identified a "memory" subset of taxa, including the persistent depletion of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, and the persistent enrichment of Alistipes finegoldii-that fails to recover even months after dietary cessation. This effect is mirrored in the host, where single-cell RNA sequencing reveals sustained alterations in intestinal MHC-II gene expression. These findings indicate that dietary fats leave a distinct and lasting imprint on the host-microbiome interactome that survives dietary intervention. Overall, this represents an advance in our understanding of the effect of high-fat diets on the host and microbiome.
